            <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a></h3>
            <p>Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company that designs, manufactures, and markets consumer electronics, computer software, and online services.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast</li>
                <li>Repetition</li>
                <li>Alignment</li>
                <li>Proximity</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Apple website excels in following the CRAP principles. It showcases strong contrast in its design elements, maintains consistency through repetition, aligns content effectively, and utilizes proximity to organize information in a user-friendly manner.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://www.example-bad-website.com/">Example Bad Website</a></h3>
            <p>This fictional website attempts to provide information but lacks proper design and usability.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Low Contrast</li>
                <li>No Repetition</li>
                <li>Disorganized Alignment</li>
                <li>Random Proximity</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This fictional website fails to follow the CRAP principles. It has low contrast, making text difficult to read. There's no repetition, leading to a lack of consistency. The alignment is disorganized, causing visual chaos, and there's little consideration for proximity, resulting in a confusing user experience.</p>
