            <p>
                My name is Ben Sarber, the sole founder, owner, and employee of Dapper Automotive Detailing.
                I have been detailing as a professional contractor for about 2 years and finally decided to start my own company.
                I’m also a full-time student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, majoring in Business Administration.
                I created Dapper to give clients a fresh, affordable, and quality service.
                Dapper’s promise is to ensure every client is completely satisfied with their car before paying a penny.
                I greatly appreciate you visiting this website and look forward to working with you!
